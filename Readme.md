## Libasm

This is a project about taking our first steps in using x86 Intel assembly. The below functions are what we were required to implement :

- read
- write
- strlen
- strcmp
- strcpy
- strdup

The testing main forthis can be found in my test repo : https://github.com/42Curriculum/test_mains

## Note :

This project was compiled for Linux and as such the makefile uses elf64 instead of macho64. I also know for a fact that any of the above functions that use **__errno_location** will not compile or run on mac.

42 students, beware
